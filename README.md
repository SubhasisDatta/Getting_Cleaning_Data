## Author/Student Name: Subhasis Datta
## Course Name: Getting and Cleaning Data
## Program: JHU Data Science Specialization
## Due Date: April 26, 2015
## Project Requirements / Description:
## Objective: Create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following:
## 1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
## 2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
## 3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
## 4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names.
## 5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

1. Download the UCI data set from the repository as identified in the project from the URl provided and Unzip in de4signated local directory 
From URL: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 

2. Create a Folder called "UCI HAR Dataset/" in local directory where you downloaded the data and create File Path for the data file to point to

3. Run the R program "run_analysis.R" from your GitHub repository called "Getting_Cleaning_Data" that creates a Tidy_Data file called "tidy_data.txt". This data set created is also uploaded in the Assignment page of this Project for review.

4. The R program "run_analysis.R" also creates an average data file called "average_data.txt". It creates the second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

5. The R program "run_analysis.R" has embedded descriptive text to describe each step of the program and what it does.

6. An additional file "CodeBook.md" is provided to describe the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data.

7. The Github repository link "https://github.com/SubhasisDatta/Getting_Cleaning_Data" is provided where all the three key files are stored: ReadMe.md, run_analysis.R and CodeBook.md to describe all the R programming for the assignment and to run amd understand the R program effectively.
