## Github Repository: Getting_Cleaning_Data 
## Author/Student Name: Subhasis Datta
## Course Name: Getting and Cleaning Data
## Program: JHU Data Science Specialization
## Due Date: April 26, 2015
## Project Requirements / Description:
## Objective: Create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following: a) Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set; b) Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement; c) Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set; d) Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names; e) Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

## 1. Download the UCI data set from the repository as identified in the project from the URl provided and Unzip in de4signated local directory 
From URL: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 

## 2. Create a Folder called "UCI HAR Dataset/" in local directory where you downloaded the data and create File Path for the data file to point to

## 3. Run the R program "run_analysis.R" from your GitHub repository called "Getting_Cleaning_Data" that creates a Tidy_Data file called "tidy_data.txt". This data set created is also uploaded in the Assignment page of this Project for review.

## 4. The R program "run_analysis.R" also creates an average data file called "average_data.txt". It creates the second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

## 5. The R program "run_analysis.R" has embedded descriptive text to describe each step of the program and what it does.

## 6. An additional file "CodeBook.md" is provided to describe the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data.

## 7. The Github repository link "https://github.com/SubhasisDatta/Getting_Cleaning_Data" is provided where all the three key files are stored: ReadMe.md, run_analysis.R and CodeBook.md to describe all the R programming for the assignment and to run amd understand the R program effectively.
